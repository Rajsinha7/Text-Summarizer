Title: 📝 AI-Powered Wikipedia & Text Summarizer
Tagline: Lightweight Generative AI app for summarizing articles and text in seconds.

Description:
This project is a Generative AI-based text summarization tool built with Streamlit and Hugging Face Transformers. It allows users to:

Paste any custom text and generate a concise AI summary.

Automatically fetch a Wikipedia article on any topic and summarize it instantly.

The app uses the sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6 model — a distilled, lightweight variant of BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers), fine-tuned for abstractive summarization.

The project demonstrates:

Generative AI via natural language generation (NLG).

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by fetching real-time Wikipedia content before summarization.

An easy-to-use web interface powered by Streamlit.

Tech Stack:
Frontend/UI: Streamlit

Backend/AI Processing: Hugging Face Transformers Pipeline

Model: sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6 (Abstractive Summarization LLM)

External API: Wikipedia Python library

Language: Python 3.x


"""

"""

Yes ✅ — your project does count as a GenAI project because:

It uses a pre-trained Transformer-based model (distilbart-cnn-12-6) that performs abstractive summarization, which is a form of natural language generation (NLG) — a key capability of Generative AI.

Even though it’s not a massive general-purpose LLM like GPT-4, it’s still a generative AI model trained on large-scale data to produce new, concise summaries.

The Wikipedia integration + summarization pipeline showcases an AI workflow combining retrieval (fetching content) and generation (creating summaries).

💡 In interviews or GitHub, you can phrase it like:

“This is a lightweight Generative AI-based summarization tool using a distilled BART model fine-tuned for news summarization. It demonstrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) on Wikipedia content and AI-powered summarization of arbitrary text.”

📝 AI Text Summarizer
An interactive AI-powered text summarization tool built with Streamlit and Hugging Face Transformers, capable of summarizing any user-provided text or automatically fetching and summarizing Wikipedia articles.

🚀 Features
Manual Text Summarization – Paste any text, and the app generates a concise summary.

Wikipedia Article Summarization – Enter a topic, fetches the Wikipedia content, and summarizes it instantly.

Fast & Lightweight Model – Uses sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6 for quick processing without heavy hardware requirements.

Clean & Responsive UI – Streamlit-based frontend for an easy, no-friction experience.

Caching for Performance – Model is loaded only once to improve speed.

🛠 Tech Stack
Frontend:

Streamlit – For creating a fast, interactive web app.

Backend & AI Processing:

Python – Core programming language.

Hugging Face Transformers – For loading the summarization model.

DistilBART (sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6) – A distilled version of BART trained on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset, optimized for summarization.

Wikipedia API (wikipedia library) – To fetch articles directly from Wikipedia.

Model Details:

Type: Pre-trained Transformer model for summarization (not a full general-purpose LLM).

Architecture: Sequence-to-sequence (encoder-decoder).

Training Data: CNN/Daily Mail news dataset.

Capabilities: Extractive & abstractive summarization.

📌 How It Works
User enters text manually or searches for a Wikipedia topic.

If Wikipedia mode is used, the app fetches the full article text.

The distilbart-cnn-12-6 model processes the text and returns a summary.

The summary is displayed in a clean UI, with a progress spinner for better UX.
