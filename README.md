This project is a Generative AI-based text summarization tool built with Streamlit and Hugging Face Transformers. It allows users to:
Paste any custom text and generate a concise AI summary.
Automatically fetch a Wikipedia article on any topic and summarize it instantly.
The app uses the sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6 model — a distilled, lightweight variant of BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers), fine-tuned for abstractive summarization.

Generative AI via natural language generation (NLG).
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by fetching real-time Wikipedia content before summarization.
An easy-to-use web interface powered by Streamlit.
